[![CI Pipeline](https://github.com/asimnajibi/smi2qm/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/asimnajibi/smi2qm/actions/workflows/ci.yaml) [![Docker Container Push Pipeline](https://github.com/asimnajibi/smi2qm/actions/workflows/dockerpush.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/asimnajibi/smi2qm/actions/workflows/dockerpush.yaml)

Limited example program that generates quantum chemically determined molecular geometries for large batches of molecules from SMILES strings, using tight-binding density functional theory methods. This can be used for ligand-based cheminformatics screening of drug-candidate molecules.

## Requires:
- Docker (https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- MongoDB (https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)

## Command line usage

1. Pull Docker image from Docker Hub:

   ```docker pull asimnajibi/smi2qm```

2. Run Docker image container, mounting local directory containing smiles files and specifying the client, database name and collection name. For example,

   ```docker run -it -v $(pwd)/SMILES:/smi2qm/SMILES --entrypoint ["conda", "run", "-n", "smi2qm", "python", "/smi2qm/smi2qm/main.py"] smi2qm:latest -c mongodb://localhost -d db_smi2qm -n coll_smi2qm```

3. Check stored data on MongoDB, view insights, manipulate, visualise, make queries

## To be expanded: Statistics of MongoDB data with NumPy
See smi2qm/npstats.py

Use ```--entrypoint ["conda", "run", "-n", "smi2qm", "python", "/smi2qm/smi2qm/npstats.py"]``` in ```docker run```

This will include tools for the entire data set.

To obtain a numpy array of atoms and corresponding atomic coordinates for a particular molecule, add option ```-s <'SMILES string'>``` or ```--smiles <'SMILES string'>```

## Other developments to add
The absence of the following two aspects may lead to inaccuracies in rare cases, but cheminformatics-based drug screening can provide useful verification.
1. XTB calculation of Hessian matrix of optimised molecular geometry and subsequent detection of imaginary frequencies leading to dump in failed-calculations MongoDB collection. Add reason of failure to the entry inserted into the failed-calculations MongoDB collection.
2. Determination of number of unpaired electrons: Would be useful for XTB calculation but cannot always be determined from SMILES string (e.g due to various possible configurations of d-orbital electrons in transition metals due to ligands).
